# MCChickenNamer
A plugin for Minecraft 1.15.2 (and some old versions I tested upto 1.12.2) that will rename any chicken to a list of customisable names.

Simply add the plugin to your plugin folder and the names.txt (or your own names.txt) to the run directory of the server and voila, all
future chickens will have a name.
